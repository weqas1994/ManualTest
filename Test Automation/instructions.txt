Attached are the Cucumber overview documents.

-	Tests (scenarios) should be defined using the gherkin syntax (https://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/ ) for easy conversion into Cucumber Feature files during automation.
-	Scenarios can reference these predefined steps which are incorporated into the framework: https://github.com/selenium-cucumber/selenium-cucumber-ruby/blob/master/doc/canned_steps.md 
-	Each feature, scenario / scenario outline and examples block should be tagged to facilitate requirements traceability and vary the test suite between environments as needed.

Below is a sample feature file in that format testing that a search returns the expected results:

@ReadOnly
Feature: Court Summons Search - Read Only
  
  Description: 
    In order to find relevant Court Summons records
    Users should be able to 
    Search records by one or more criteria
    Role: Read Only

  Background: Navigate to the Court Summons application home page
    Given I log in using ReadOnly_user and navigate to the application
    Then I should see page title as "Court Summons"

  @Regression @Smoke @ReadOnly @Issues:CAOMS-483
  Scenario Outline: Search by Court Number <CourtNumber> #CAOMS-483
    Then the Search page is displayed
    And element having name "courtNumberSearchField" should be enabled
    When I type "<CourtNumber>" into the Court Number search field
    And I click on element having id "searchButton"
    Then the search results are displayed
    And the search results display records for Court Number "<CourtNumber>"
    When I click the first record
    Then the Court Number "<CourtNumber>" screen displays
    And the detail Court Number field is "<CourtNumber>"
